## Introduction

`is` is an inspector for your environment. `is` tries to make it just a little bit
easier to run commands which rely on a specific OS or a specific CLI version.

### Is the minimum version of this tool available?

```bash
is cli version tmux gt 3.2 && echo ü•≥ || echo üò¢
```

### Is this the target Operating System?

```bash
(is os name eq darwin && echo üçè ) || (is os name eq linux && echo üêß) || echo üí£
```

### Check the OS with a Regex

```bash
is os name like "da\w{4}" && echo üçè
```

### Do we have go? Then update go binaries used by vim-go

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if is there go; then
    nvim +:GoUpdateBinaries +qa || true
fi
```

Or, as a one-liner:

```bash
is there go && nvim +:GoUpdateBinaries +qa
```

### What's the version of bash?

```text
$ is known cli version bash
5.2.15
```

### Has gofumpt been modified in the last week?

```text
$ is cli age gofumpt lt 7 d
5.2.15
```

### echo the OS name

```text
$ echo "i'm on $(is known os name) for sure"
i'm on darwin for sure
```

### Get some debugging information about the OS

```text
$ is known os name --debug
{
    "name": "darwin",
    "version": "13.4",
    "version-codename": "ventura"
}
darwin
```

```text
is known os name --debug
{
    "id": "ubuntu",
    "id-like": "debian",
    "name": "linux",
    "pretty-name": "Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS",
    "version": "22.04",
    "version-codename": "jammy"
}
linux
```

### Can user sudo without a password?

```bash
is user sudoer || echo üò≠
```

## Exit Codes are Everything

`is` returns an exit code of `0` on success and non-zero (usually `1`) on
failure. You can leverage this in shell scripting:

In a script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if is os name eq darwin; then
  # This is a Mac. Creating karabiner config dir."
  mkdir -p "$HOME/.config/karabiner"
fi
```

At the command line:

```bash
is os name ne darwin && echo "this is not a mac"
```

### Debugging error Codes

In `bash` and `zsh` (and possibly other shells), `$?` contains the value of the
last command's exit code.

```text
$ is os name eq x
$ echo $?
1
$ is os name eq darwin
0
```

### Using a Regex

The `like` and `unlike` operators accept a regular expression. You may need to quote your regex. For instance:

```bash
is os name like darw\w
```

should be

```bash
is os name like "darw\w"
```

Use the debug flag to see how your regex may have been changed by your shell:

```text
$ is os name like darw\w --debug
comparing regex "darww" with darwin
```

In this case we can see that the unquoted `\w` is turned into `w` by the shell because it was not quoted.

You can also use regexes with no special characters at all:

```bash
is os version-codename unlike ventura
```

## Top Level Commands

### arch

Checks against the arch which this binary has been compiled for.

```
is arch eq amd64
```

```
is arch like 64
```

Supported comparisons are:

* `lt`
* `gt`
* `like`
* `unlike`

Try `is known arch` to get the value for your installed binary or run this command with the `--debug` flag.

Theoretical possibilites are:

```text
386
amd64
arm
arm64
loong64
mips
mips64
mips64le
mipsle
ppc64
ppc64le
riscv64
s390x
wasm
```

however, there are available binaries for only some of these values.

### cli

#### age

Compare against the last modified date of a command's file.

```bash
is cli age tmux lt 18 hours
```

Don't let `goimports` get more than a week out of date.

```bash
is cli age goimports gt 7 days && go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports@latest
```

Update `shfmt` basically daily, but only if `go` is installed.

```bash
if is there go; then
    if is cli age shfmt gt 18 hours; then
        go install mvdan.cc/sh/v3/cmd/shfmt@latest
    fi
else
    echo "Go not found. Not installing shfmt"
fi
```

Supported comparisons are:

* `lt`
* `gt`

Supported units are:

* `s`
* `second`
* `seconds`
* `m`
* `minute`
* `minutes`
* `h`
* `hour`
* `hours`
* `d`
* `day`
* `days`

Note that `d|day|days` is shorthand for 24 hours. DST offsets are not taken
into account here.

The `--debug` flag can give you some helpful information when troubleshooting
date math.

#### version

Compare versions of available commands. Returns exit code of 0 if condition is
true and exit code of 1 if condition is false.

```bash
is cli version go gte 1.20.4 || bash upgrade-go.sh
```

Supported comparisons are:

* `lt`
* `lte`
* `eq`
* `gte`
* `gt`
* `ne`
* `like`
* `unlike`

### os

Information specific to the current operating system

#### version

```bash
is os version gt 22
```

```bash
is os version like "13.4.\d"
```

Supported comparisons are:

* `lt`
* `lte`
* `eq`
* `gte`
* `gt`
* `ne`
* `like`
* `unlike`

#### name

Under the hood, this returns the value of `runtime.GOOS`, a constant which is
set at compile time. So, `is` reports on on the OS name which is the target of
build rather than running `uname` or something like that. This is "good enough"
for my purposes. If it's not good enough for yours, we probably need to add
more build targets.

Available comparisons are:

* `eq`
* `ne`
* `like`
* `unlike`

##### Equality

```bash
is os name eq darwin
```

##### Inequality

```bash
is os name ne linux
```

##### Regex

```bash
is os name like darw
```

```bash
is os name like "dar\w{3}"
```

```bash
is os name unlike "foo\d"
```

Possible values for `name`:

```text
darwin
linux
```

##### pretty-name

Linux only.

```bash
is os pretty-name eq "Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS"
```

Available comparisons are:

* `eq`
* `ne`
* `like`
* `unlike`

##### id

Linux only.

```bash
is os id eq ubuntu
```

Available comparisons are:

* `eq`
* `ne`
* `like`
* `unlike`

##### id-like

```bash
is os id-like eq debian
```

Available comparisons are:

* `eq`
* `ne`
* `like`
* `unlike``

##### version-codename

```bash
is os version-codename eq jammy
```

Available comparisons are:

* `eq`
* `ne`
* `like`
* `unlike`

On Linux, the value for `version-codename` is taken from `/etc/os-release`. For
Macs, the values are mapped inside this application.

Possible values for Mac:

* ventura
* monterey
* big sur
* catalina
* mojave
* high sierra
* sierra
* el capitan
* yosemite
* mavericks
* mountain lion

### there

Returns exit code of 0 if command exists and exit code of 1 if command cannot
be found.

```bash
is there tmux && echo "we have tmux"
```

### user

#### sudoer

```bash
is user sudoer && sudo apt-get install ripgrep
```

Returns 1 if the current appears to be able to `sudo` without being prompted
for a password.

This is useful for scripts where you want to install via `sudo`, but you don't
want the script to be interactive. That means you can skip installing things
that require `sudo` and handle them in some other place.

### known

Prints known information about a resource to `STDOUT`. Returns `0` on success
and `1` if info cannot be found.

#### arch

Prints the value of `runtime.GOARCH`. Note that this is the arch that the binary was compiled for. It's not running `uname` under the hood.

Theoretical possibilites are:

```text
386
amd64
arm
arm64
loong64
mips
mips64
mips64le
mipsle
ppc64
ppc64le
riscv64
s390x
wasm
```

however, there are available binaries for only some of these values.

#### os

Details specific to the current operating system.

##### name

Under the hood, this returns the value of `runtime.GOOS`, a constant which is
set at compile time. So, `is` reports on on the OS name which is the target of
build rather than running `uname` or something like that. This is "good enough"
for my purposes. If it's not good enough for yours, we probably need to add
more build targets.

```text
$ is known os name
linux
```

Possible values for `name`:

```text
darwin
linux
```

##### pretty-name

Linux only.

```text
$ is known os pretty-name

```

##### id

Linux only.

```text
$ is known os id
ubuntu
```

##### id-like

```text
$ is known os id-like
debian
```

##### version

$ is known os version
22.04
```

##### version-codename

```text

jammy
```

#### cli version

Comparison failed: darwin eq darwins
```

### --help

Top level command help.

```text

## Installation

* [Download a release](https://github.com/oalders/is/releases)
* `go install`
  * `go install github.com/oalders/is@latest`
  * `go install github.com/oalders/is@v0.1.3`
* Use [ubi](https://github.com/houseabsolute/ubi)

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -eux

INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/local/bin"

if [ ! "$(command -v ubi)" ]; then
    curl --silent --location \
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/houseabsolute/ubi/master/bootstrap/bootstrap-ubi.sh |
        TARGET=$INSTALL_DIR sh
fi

ubi --project oalders/is --in "$INSTALL_DIR"
```

## Bonus: Easier Version Parsing of Available Tools

Forget about the remembering the different `version` incantations of command
line tools. Don't make up regexes to extract the actual version number.
